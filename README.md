# FilmAPI
This is an attempt to reconstruct the lost web API project for cataloging and querying my largish film collection on DVDs and BDs. Past experience has shown that the second attempt to build a project deliberately thrown away or stupidly lost turns out better than the first attempt, because one (hopefully) learns from the mistakes made on the first attempt.
